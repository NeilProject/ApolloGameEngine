This is just a quick command referrence. I am not teaching you here how to use the Neil scripting language (nor how the underlying Lua engine works), it's just a quick referrence.


# Core 
These functions will allow you to get a few things done from the very core of Apollo.

## void Flow.GoToFlow(string flow) 
Can also be called as GoToFlow(flow)
Will switch from one flow to another. Please note, the function calling this will be completed, as well as the entire callback. Only callbacks called later will be affected.

## Property String Flow.CurrentFlow
Contains the current flow. You can also assign a new flow it it... Will have the same effect as "GoToFlow"

## void Flow.Quit(int exitcode=0)
Will end Apollo and leave an exit code if applied.
Notes:
- NEVER use os.exit() provided by Lua for this. Apollo uses drivers and puts data in the memory it has to unload first. os.exit() won't take care of that. Flow.Quit() does.
- Flow.Quit() will finish the callback that it was called in first, and possibly a few more callbacks can be called also. This is a safety pre-caution. Once called the Quit procedure cannot be undone, though.
